# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Adding a changeset

When you make changes that should be released, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select the type of change (major, minor, patch)
2. Write a summary of the changes

The changeset file will be committed with your PR.

## Releasing

When changesets are merged to main, a GitHub Action will:
1. Create a "Version Packages" PR with version bumps and CHANGELOG updates
2. When that PR is merged, it creates a git tag
3. The tag triggers the release workflow to publish to npm
